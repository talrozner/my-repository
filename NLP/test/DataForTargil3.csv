0,0,"With all this stuff going down at the moment with MJ i've started listening to his music, watching the odd documentary here and there, watched The Wiz and watched Moonwalker again. Maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part biography, part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released. Some of it has subtle messages about MJ's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m'kay.<br /><br />Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Jackson so unless you remotely like MJ in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring. Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him.<br /><br />The actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord. Why he wants MJ dead so bad is beyond me. Because MJ overheard his plans? Nah, Joe Pesci's character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno, maybe he just hates MJ's music.<br /><br />Lots of cool things in this like MJ turning into a car and a robot and the whole Speed Demon sequence. Also, the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy Bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene.<br /><br />Bottom line, this movie is for people who like MJ on one level or another (which i think is most people). If not, then stay away. It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJ's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty? Well, with all the attention i've gave this subject....hmmm well i don't know because people can be different behind closed doors, i know this for a fact. He is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars. I hope he is not the latter.",1,with all this stuff going down at the moment with mj ive started listening to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent moonwalker is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released some of it has subtle messages about mjs feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad mkaybr br visually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring some may call mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie but mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of himbr br the actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the smooth criminal sequence and joe pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord why he wants mj dead so bad is beyond me because mj overheard his plans nah joe pescis character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates mjs musicbr br lots of cool things in this like mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scenebr br bottom line this movie is for people who like mj on one level or another which i think is most people if not then stay away it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically mjs bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty? well with all the attention ive gave this subjecthmmm well i dont know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars i hope he is not the latter,stuff go moment mj ive start listen music watch odd documentary watch wiz watch moonwalker maybe want get certain insight guy think wa really cool eighty maybe make mind whether guilty innocent moonwalker part biography part feature film remember go see cinema wa originally release ha subtle message mjs feel towards press also obvious message drug bad mkaybr br visually impressive course michael jackson unless remotely like mj anyway go hate find bore may call mj egotist consent make movie mj fan would say make fan true really nice himbr br actual feature film bite finally start 20 minute exclude smooth criminal sequence joe pesci convince psychopathic powerful drug lord want mj dead bad beyond mj overhear plan nah joe pescis character rant want people know supply drug etc dunno maybe hate mjs musicbr br lot cool thing like mj turn car robot whole speed demon sequence also director must patience saint come film kiddy bad sequence usually director hate work one kid let alone whole bunch perform complex dance scenebr br bottom line movie people like mj one level another think people stay away doe try give wholesome message ironically mjs bestest buddy movie girl! michael jackson truly one talented people ever grace planet guilty? well attention ive give subjecthmmm well dont know people different behind close door know fact either extremely nice stupid guy one sickest liar hope latter,IN PDT DT NN VBG RP IN DT NN IN NN PRP VB VBN VBG IN PRP$ NN VBG DT JJ NN RB CC EX VBD DT NN CC VBN NN RB RB PRP RB VBP TO VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN WP PRP VBD VBD RB JJ IN DT NNS RB TO RB VB RP PRP$ NN IN PRP VBZ JJ CC JJ NN VBZ NN NN NN NN NN WDT PRP VBP VBG TO VB IN DT NN WRB PRP VBD RB VBN DT IN PRP VBZ JJ NNS IN VBP NN IN DT NN CC RB DT JJ NN IN NNS VBP JJ JJ NN RB JJ CC IN NN DT VBZ RB IN NN NN IN IN PRP RB UH NN RB UH RB PRP VBP VBG TO VB DT CC VB PRP VBG DT MD VB PRP DT NN IN VBG IN DT NN IN DT NN CC NN CC JJS IN PRP$ NNS MD VB IN PRP VBD PRP IN DT NNS WDT IN JJ VBZ RB JJ IN VBN NN DT JJ NN NN NN WRB PRP RB VBZ VBZ RB IN IN CD NNS CC RB VBG DT JJ JJ NN CC NN NN VBZ JJ IN DT JJ DT JJ NN NN WRB PRP VBZ RB JJ RB JJ VBZ IN PRP IN PRP VBP PRP$ NNS DT NN NN NN VBD IN PRP VBD NNS TO VB PRP VBZ PRP WP VBZ VBG NNS FW RB PRP VBP RB PRP RB VBZ VBP NN NN NNS IN JJ NNS IN DT UH NN VBG IN DT NN CC DT NN CC DT JJ NN NN NN RB DT NN MD VB VBN DT NN IN DT NN WRB PRP VBD IN VBG DT NN JJ NN IN RB NNS VBP VBG IN CD NN VBN RB DT JJ NN IN PRP VBG DT JJ NN NN NN JJ NN DT NN VBZ IN NNS WP VBP NN IN CD NN CC DT WDT PRP VBP VBZ JJS NNS IN RB RB VB RB PRP VBZ VB CC VB RP DT JJ NN CC RB VB JJS NN IN DT NN VBZ DT NN .

1,1,"\The Classic War of the Worlds\"" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate H. G. Wells' classic book. Mr. Hines succeeds in doing so. I, and those who watched his film with me, appreciated the fact that it was not the standard, predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year, e.g. the Spielberg version with Tom Cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book. Obviously, everyone looks for different things in a movie. Those who envision themselves as amateur \""critics\"" look only to criticize everything they can. Others rate a movie on more important bases,like being entertained, which is why most people never agree with the \""critics\"". We enjoyed the effort Mr. Hines put into being faithful to H.G. Wells' classic novel, and we found it to be very entertaining. This made it easy to overlook what the \""critics\"" perceive to be its shortcomings.""",1,"the classic war of the worlds by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h g wells classic book mr hines succeeds in doing so i and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year eg the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie those who envision themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can others rate a movie on more important baseslike being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics we enjoyed the effort mr hines put into being faithful to hg wells classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining this made it easy to overlook what the \""critics\"" perceive to be its shortcomings""","classic war world timothy hines entertain film obviously go great effort length faithfully recreate h g well classic book mr hines succeed watch film appreciate fact wa standard predictable hollywood fare come every year eg spielberg version tom cruise slightest resemblance book obviously everyone look different thing movie envision amateur critic look criticize everything others rate movie important baseslike entertain people never agree critic enjoy effort mr hines put faithful hg well classic novel find entertain make easy overlook \""critics\"" perceive shortcomings""",DT JJ NN IN DT NNS IN JJ NNS VBZ DT RB JJ NN WDT RB VBZ IN JJ NN CC NNS TO RB VB FW FW NNS JJ NN NN NNS VBZ IN VBG RB PRP CC DT WP VBD PRP$ NN IN PRP VBD DT NN IN PRP VBD RB DT JJ JJ NN NN WDT VBZ RP DT NN NN DT NN NN IN JJ NN WDT VBD RB DT JJS NN IN DT NN RB NN VBZ IN JJ NNS IN DT NN DT WP VBP PRP IN JJ NNS VBP RB TO VB NN PRP MD NNS VB DT NN IN RBR JJ JJ VBG VBN WDT VBZ WRB JJS NNS RB VBP IN DT NNS PRP VBD DT NN NN NNS VBD IN VBG JJ IN VB NNS JJ NN CC PRP VBD PRP TO VB RB JJ DT VBD PRP JJ TO VB WP DT JJ `` JJ TO VB PRP$ NNS '',DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN VERB DET ADV ADJ NOUN ADJ ADV VERB ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ NOUN PART ADV VERB X X NOUN ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB ADP VERB ADV PRON CCONJ DET NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN ADP PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP PRON VERB ADV DET ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN ADJ VERB PART DET NOUN NOUN DET NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADJ VERB ADV DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADV NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN DET NOUN VERB PRON ADP ADJ NOUN VERB ADV PART VERB NOUN PRON VERB NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP ADV ADJ ADJ VERB VERB ADJ VERB ADV ADJ NOUN ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN PRON VERB DET NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB ADP VERB ADJ ADP VERB NOUN ADJ NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB PRON PART VERB ADV ADJ DET VERB PRON ADJ PART VERB NOUN DET ADJ PUNCT ADJ PART VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT,det amod nsubj prep det pobj prep compound pobj ROOT det advmod amod attr nsubj advmod relcl prep amod pobj cc conj aux advmod advcl compound nmod nmod amod compound compound dobj advcl prep pcomp advmod dobj cc conj nsubj relcl poss dobj prep pobj advcl det dobj mark nsubj acl neg det amod amod compound attr nsubj relcl prt det npadvmod prep det compound pobj prep amod pobj nsubj relcl advmod det amod dobj prep det pobj advmod nsubj acl prep amod pobj prep det pobj appos nsubj relcl dobj mark amod nsubj advcl advmod aux xcomp dobj nsubj aux nsubj relcl det dobj prep advmod amod nsubjpass auxpass pobj nsubj relcl advmod amod nsubj neg ccomp prep det pobj nsubj relcl det dobj aux nsubj ROOT prep pcomp acomp prep nmod nmod amod pobj cc nsubj conj nsubj aux ccomp advmod acomp nsubj ROOT nsubj ccomp aux advcl dobj det nsubj punct ccomp aux advcl poss attr punct,DATE ORG,DT-JJ JJ-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-NNS NNS-IN IN-JJ JJ-NNS NNS-VBZ VBZ-DT DT-RB RB-JJ JJ-NN NN-WDT WDT-RB RB-VBZ VBZ-IN IN-JJ JJ-NN NN-CC CC-NNS NNS-TO TO-RB RB-VB VB-FW FW-FW FW-NNS NNS-JJ JJ-NN NN-NN NN-NNS NNS-VBZ VBZ-IN IN-VBG VBG-RB RB-PRP PRP-CC CC-DT DT-WP WP-VBD VBD-PRP$ PRP$-NN NN-IN IN-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-RB RB-DT DT-JJ JJ-JJ JJ-NN NN-NN NN-WDT WDT-VBZ VBZ-RP RP-DT DT-NN NN-NN NN-DT DT-NN NN-NN NN-IN IN-JJ JJ-NN NN-WDT WDT-VBD VBD-RB RB-DT DT-JJS JJS-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-RB RB-NN NN-VBZ VBZ-IN IN-JJ JJ-NNS NNS-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-DT DT-WP WP-VBP VBP-PRP PRP-IN IN-JJ JJ-NNS NNS-VBP VBP-RB RB-TO TO-VB VB-NN NN-PRP PRP-MD MD-NNS NNS-VB VB-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-RBR RBR-JJ JJ-JJ JJ-VBG VBG-VBN VBN-WDT WDT-VBZ VBZ-WRB WRB-JJS JJS-NNS NNS-RB RB-VBP VBP-IN IN-DT DT-NNS NNS-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-DT DT-NN NN-NN NN-NNS NNS-VBD VBD-IN IN-VBG VBG-JJ JJ-IN IN-VB VB-NNS NNS-JJ JJ-NN NN-CC CC-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-PRP PRP-TO TO-VB VB-RB RB-JJ JJ-DT DT-VBD VBD-PRP PRP-JJ JJ-TO TO-VB VB-WP WP-DT DT-JJ JJ-`` ``-JJ JJ-TO TO-VB VB-PRP$ PRP$-NNS NNS-''
2,2,"The film starts with a manager (Nicholas Bell) giving welcome investors (Robert Carradine) to Primal Park . A secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized DNA, like ¨Jurassik Park¨, and some scientists resurrect one of nature's most fearsome predators, the Sabretooth tiger or Smilodon . Scientific ambition turns deadly, however, and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey - the human visitors , tourists and scientific.Meanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre-historical animals which are deadlier and bigger . In addition , a security agent (Stacy Haiduk) and her mate (Brian Wimmer) fight hardly against the carnivorous Smilodons. The Sabretooths, themselves , of course, are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing. The giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one nature's most fearsome predators. Furthermore a third Sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victims.<br /><br />The movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading, hair-raising chills,full of scares when the Sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects.The story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring .The giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy .Middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food.Actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts ,running,bound and leaps or dangling over walls . And it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene. No for small kids by realistic,gory and violent attack scenes . Other films about Sabretooths or Smilodon are the following : ¨Sabretooth(2002)¨by James R Hickox with Vanessa Angel, David Keith and John Rhys Davies and the much better ¨10.000 BC(2006)¨ by Roland Emmerich with with Steven Strait, Cliff Curtis and Camilla Belle. This motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by George Miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films. Miller is an Australian director usually working for television (Tidal wave, Journey to the center of the earth, and many others) and occasionally for cinema ( The man from Snowy river, Zeus and Roxanne,Robinson Crusoe ).

4,4,"Superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80's exploitation, hooray! The pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama, but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we're up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles, rough fist-fights, lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity! Bo and Ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship. Can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister's naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes? Well, Bo does that to his sister and, judging by her dubbed laughter, she doesn't mind at all. Sick, dude! Anyway, as kids they fled from Russia with their parents, but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy. A friendly smuggler took custody over them, however, and even raised and trained Bo and Ingrid into expert smugglers. When the actual plot lifts off, 20 years later, they're facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable White Fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine. Very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of \White Fire\"", but it sure is a lot of fun to watch. Most of the time you have no clue who's beating up who or for what cause (and I bet the actors understood even less) but whatever! The violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded. The script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and I won't reveal for what reason  Bo needs a replacement for Ingrid and Fred Williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes.

The movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything, it just keeps plodding on. Christopher Walken has a part, but it is completely senseless, as is most of the movie.

7,7,"I watched this video at a friend's house. I'm glad I did not waste money buying this one. The video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie Capricorn One. The movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow-ups, most not related to manned flight. Sibrel's smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast. He edits in his own voice-over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say. The video curiously ends with a showing of the Zapruder film. His claims about radiation, shielding, star photography, and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against NASA, the astronauts, or American in general.

8,8,"A friend of mine bought this film for £1, and even then it was grossly overpriced. Despite featuring big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole. It uses tired, bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of 'hot girls'.<br /><br />Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women. When the ship's resident comedian - the shamelessly named 'Dickie' due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender - is presumed lost at sea, Sandler's character Shecker gets his big break. Dickie is not dead, he's rather locked in the bathroom, presumably sea sick.<br /><br />Perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time.",0,a friend of mine bought this film for 1 and even then it was grossly overpriced despite featuring big names such as adam sandler billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole it uses tired bottom of the barrel comedic techniques  consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience and seemingly pointless montages of hot girlsbr br adam sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women when the ships resident comedian  the shamelessly named dickie due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender  is presumed lost at sea sandlers character shecker gets his big break dickie is not dead hes rather locked in the bathroom presumably sea sickbr br perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time,friend mine buy film 1 even wa grossly overprice despite feature big name adam sandler billy bob thornton incredibly talented burt young film wa funny take chisel hammer straight earhole us tire bottom barrel comedic technique  consistently break fourth wall sandler talk audience seemingly pointless montage hot girlsbr br adam sandler play waiter cruise ship want make successful comedian order become successful woman ship resident comedian  shamelessly name dickie due unfathomable success opposite gender  presume lose sea sandlers character shecker get big break dickie dead rather lock bathroom presumably sea sickbr br perhaps mouth vomit worst film time,DT NN IN PRP VBD DT NN IN CD CC RB RB PRP VBD RB VBN IN VBG JJ NNS JJ IN JJ NN RB VBZ NN CC DT RB JJ NN JJ DT NN VBD RB RB JJ IN VBG DT NN CC VBG PRP RB IN PRP$ NN PRP VBZ JJ NN IN DT NN JJ NNS  RB VBG DT JJ NN IN NN NNS IN DT NN CC RB JJ NNS IN JJ JJ NN JJ NN VBZ DT NN IN DT NN NN WP VBZ TO VB PRP IN DT JJ NN IN NN TO VB JJ IN NNS WRB DT NNS NN NN  DT RB VBN NN IN IN PRP$ JJ NN IN DT JJ NN  VBZ VBN VBN IN NN NNS NN NN VBZ PRP$ JJ NN NN VBZ RB JJ PRP VBZ RB VBN IN DT NN RB NN NN NN RB IN PRP$ NN PRP RB VBD DT JJS NN IN DT NN,DET NOUN ADP PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP NUM CCONJ ADV ADV PRON VERB ADV VERB ADP VERB ADJ NOUN ADJ ADP ADJ NOUN ADV VERB NOUN CCONJ DET ADV ADJ NOUN ADJ DET NOUN VERB ADV ADV ADJ ADP VERB DET NOUN CCONJ VERB PRON ADV ADP ADJ NOUN PRON VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADJ NOUN SPACE ADV VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ ADV ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN ADJ NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB PART VERB PRON ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PART VERB ADJ ADP NOUN ADV DET NOUN NOUN NOUN SPACE DET ADV VERB NOUN ADP ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN SPACE VERB VERB VERB ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB ADV ADJ PRON VERB ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN ADV NOUN NOUN NOUN ADV ADP ADJ NOUN PRON ADV VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN,det nsubj prep pobj ROOT det dobj prep pobj cc advmod advmod nsubjpass auxpass advmod conj prep pcomp amod dobj amod prep amod nmod advmod amod pobj cc det advmod amod conj dobj det nsubj conj advmod advmod acomp prep pcomp det dobj cc conj dobj advmod prep poss pobj nsubj advcl amod dobj prep det nmod amod pobj  advmod xcomp det amod dobj prep compound pobj prep det pobj cc advmod amod nsubj prep amod amod nmod amod pobj conj det dobj prep det compound pobj nsubj relcl aux xcomp dobj prep det amod pobj prep pobj aux acl acomp prep pobj advmod det nsubj amod dobj  det advmod amod npadvmod prep pcomp poss amod pobj prep det amod pobj  auxpass conj xcomp prep compound compound compound pobj advcl poss amod compound nsubj ccomp neg acomp nsubjpass auxpass advmod conj prep det pobj advmod compound compound dobj advmod prep poss pobj nsubj advmod conj det amod dobj prep det pobj,CARDINAL ORDINAL PERSON,DT-NN NN-IN IN-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-CD CD-CC CC-RB RB-RB RB-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-RB RB-VBN VBN-IN IN-VBG VBG-JJ JJ-NNS NNS-JJ JJ-IN IN-JJ JJ-NN NN-RB RB-VBZ VBZ-NN NN-CC CC-DT DT-RB RB-JJ JJ-NN NN-JJ JJ-DT DT-NN NN-VBD VBD-RB RB-RB RB-JJ JJ-IN IN-VBG VBG-DT DT-NN NN-CC CC-VBG VBG-PRP PRP-RB RB-IN IN-PRP$ PRP$-NN NN-PRP PRP-VBZ VBZ-JJ JJ-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-JJ JJ-NNS NNS-RB RB-VBG VBG-DT DT-JJ JJ-NN NN-IN IN-NN NN-NNS NNS-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-CC CC-RB RB-JJ JJ-NNS NNS-IN IN-JJ JJ-JJ JJ-NN NN-JJ JJ-NN NN-VBZ VBZ-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-NN NN-WP WP-VBZ VBZ-TO TO-VB VB-PRP PRP-IN IN-DT DT-JJ JJ-NN NN-IN IN-NN NN-TO TO-VB VB-JJ JJ-IN IN-NNS NNS-WRB WRB-DT DT-NNS NNS-NN NN-NN NN-DT DT-RB RB-VBN VBN-NN NN-IN IN-IN IN-PRP$ PRP$-JJ JJ-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-JJ JJ-NN NN-VBZ VBZ-VBN VBN-VBN VBN-IN IN-NN NN-NNS NNS-NN NN-NN NN-VBZ VBZ-PRP$ PRP$-JJ JJ-NN NN-NN NN-VBZ VBZ-RB RB-JJ JJ-PRP PRP-VBZ VBZ-RB RB-VBN VBN-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-RB RB-NN NN-NN NN-NN NN-RB RB-IN IN-PRP$ PRP$-NN NN-PRP PRP-RB RB-VBD VBD-DT DT-JJS JJS-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-NN

16,16,"`The Matrix' was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its `Twilight Zone'-ish manner. The general rule applies here- and this sequel doesn't match up to its predecessor. Worse than that, it doesn't even compare with it.<br /><br />`Reloaded' explodes onto the screen in the most un-professional fashion. In the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as Trinity is shot in a dream. Immediately after that, the film nose-dives. After a disastrous first 45 minutes, it gradually gains momentum when they enter the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle takes place. But it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan-worthy twist at the end. Worst of all is the overlong `Zion Rave' scene. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but it's also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music.<br /><br />The bullet-time aspect of `The Matrix' was a good addition, but in `'Reloaded' they overuse to make it seem boring. In the first one there were interesting plot turns, but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting. The movie is basically, just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is. It works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better. It appears that `The Matrix' franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the `Star Wars' saga have.<br /><br />The acting standard is poor for the most part. The best character of course goes to Hugo Weaving's `Agent Smith'- the only one to be slightly interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo, but in all the special effects, there is little room to make much of an impact. Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue. Carrie Ann Moss' part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress. <br /><br />A poor, thrown-together movie, `The Matrix Reloaded' is a disappointment. Those who didn't like the first one are unlikely to flock to it. This one's for die-hard fans only. Even in the movie's own sub-genre of special effect bonanzas (Minority Report, The Matrix etc.) this is still rather poor.

17,17,"Ulli Lommel's 1980 film 'The Boogey Man' is no classic, but it's an above average low budget chiller that's worth a look. The sequel, 1983s 'Boogey Man II' is ultimately a waste of time, but at the very least it's an entertaining one if not taken the least bit seriously. Now II left the door open for another sequel, and I for one wouldn't have minded seeing at least one more. One day while I was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall I came across a film entitled 'Return of the Boogey Man.' When I found out it was a sequel to the earlier films I was happy to shell out a few bucks for it...I should have known better. Though the opening title is 'Boogey Man 3,' this is no sequel to those two far superior films I named above. Well, not totally anyway.<br /><br />Pros: Ha! That's a laugh. Is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung? Let's see...it has footage from 'The Boogey Man' and, um...it's mercifully short. Yeah, that's about it.<br /><br />Cons: Where to start? Decisions, decisions. First of all, this movie is a total bore. It goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening. The acting is stiff at best. The \actors\"" are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before, and probably none since. The plot is nonexistent and script shoddily written. The direction is just plain awful. The director tries to make the film look all artsy fartsy by making the camera move around, lights flicker, and with filters, but it adds nothing. The music is dull and hard to hear in parts. Ties to the original are botched. Suzanna Love's character was named Lacey, not Natalie! And the events depicted in the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978. Also, if this has a 3 in the title, why is there no mention of what happened in II? Finally, this adds nothing new or interesting to either the series or the genre.<br /><br />Final thoughts: The people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves. It's one thing if that had been an original film that was the director's first and sucked. But instead it's supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece, but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this. If there ever is another sequel, which I doubt it, then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by Lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror film.<br /><br />My rating: 1/5""",0,"ulli lommels 1980 film the boogey man is no classic but its an above average low budget chiller thats worth a look the sequel 1983s boogey man ii is ultimately a waste of time but at the very least its an entertaining one if not taken the least bit seriously now ii left the door open for another sequel and i for one wouldnt have minded seeing at least one more one day while i was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall i came across a film entitled return of the boogey man when i found out it was a sequel to the earlier films i was happy to shell out a few bucks for iti should have known better though the opening title is boogey man 3 this is no sequel to those two far superior films i named above well not totally anywaybr br pros: ha! thats a laugh is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung? lets seeit has footage from the boogey man and umits mercifully short yeah thats about itbr br cons: where to start? decisions decisions first of all this movie is a total bore it goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening the acting is stiff at best the \actors\"" are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before and probably none since the plot is nonexistent and script shoddily written the direction is just plain awful the director tries to make the film look all artsy fartsy by making the camera move around lights flicker and with filters but it adds nothing the music is dull and hard to hear in parts ties to the original are botched suzanna loves character was named lacey not natalie! and the events depicted in the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978 also if this has a 3 in the title why is there no mention of what happened in ii? finally this adds nothing new or interesting to either the series or the genrebr br final thoughts: the people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves its one thing if that had been an original film that was the directors first and sucked but instead its supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this if there ever is another sequel which i doubt it then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror filmbr br my rating: 15""","ulli lommels 1980 film boogey man classic average low budget chiller thats worth look sequel 1983s boogey man ii ultimately waste time least entertain one take least bite seriously ii leave door open another sequel one wouldnt mind see least one one day wa browse though video store mall come across film entitle return boogey man find wa sequel earlier film wa happy shell buck iti know better though open title boogey man 3 sequel two far superior film name well totally anywaybr br pros: ha! thats laugh anything good hunk cow dung? let seeit ha footage boogey man umits mercifully short yeah thats itbr br cons: start? decision decision first movie total bore go one scene next without anything remotely interest scary happen act stiff best \actors\"" likely friend director act experience whatsoever probably none since plot nonexistent script shoddily write direction plain awful director try make film look artsy fartsy make camera move around light flicker filter add nothing music dull hard hear part tie original botch suzanna love character wa name lacey natalie! event depict begin original take place 1978 also ha 3 title mention happen ii? finally add nothing new interest either series genrebr br final thoughts: people behind waste time money ashamed one thing original film wa director first suck instead suppose sequel film masterpiece damn sure far interest entertain ever another sequel doubt need forget one ever happen handle either lommel someone ha least idea make decent horror filmbr br rating: 15""",JJ NNS CD NN DT NN NN VBZ DT JJ CC PRP$ DT JJ JJ JJ NN NN WDT VBZ JJ DT NN DT NN CD NN NN VBZ VBZ RB DT NN IN NN CC IN DT RB JJS PRP$ DT JJ NN IN RB VBN DT JJS NN RB RB VBZ VBN DT NN JJ IN DT NN CC PRP IN PRP MD RB VB VBN VBG RB RBS CD JJR CD NN IN PRP VBD VBG IN DT NNS IN DT NN IN DT NN PRP VBD IN DT NN VBN NN IN DT JJ NN WRB PRP VBD RP PRP VBD DT NN IN DT JJR NNS PRP VBD JJ TO VB RP DT JJ NNS IN NN MD VB VBN JJR IN DT NN NN VBZ JJ NN CD DT VBZ DT NN IN DT CD JJ JJ NNS PRP VBD RB RB RB RB NN NN NNS : UH .

At the moment, Raj Kumar follows her, and a strong gale of wind blew away the veil of Kumari and onto the legs of Kumar........<br /><br />Kamal Amrohi shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of Indian Cinema's history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting 12 years.

19,19,"Most people, especially young people, may not understand this film. It looks like a story of loss, when it is actually a story about being alone. Some people may never feel loneliness at this level.<br /><br />Cheadles character Johnson reflected the total opposite of Sandlers character Fineman. Where Johnson felt trapped by his blessings, Fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective. Jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and Sandler pulls tears. Cheadle had the comic role and was a great supporter for Sandler.<br /><br />I see Oscars somewhere here. A very fine film.

20,20,"\Soylent Green\"" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70's and still very persuasive even by today's standards. Although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking. This film's quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary SF flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider classic. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in a great shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets... The script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax doesn't really come as a big surprise, still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny. The riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70's cinema. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there's a great (but too modest) supportive role for Joseph Cotton (\""Baron Blood\"", \""The Abominable Dr. Phibes\""). THIS is Science-Fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! No fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.""",1,"soylent green is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70s and still very persuasive even by todays standards although flawed and a little dated the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise typical for that time still feel very unsettling and thoughtprovoking this films qualitylevel surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that i personally consider classic the new york of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive with overpopulation unemployment an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product the only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the soylent company charlton heston in a great shape plays a cop investigating the murder of one of soylents most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets the script is a little oversentimental at times and the climax doesnt really come as a big surprise still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny the riotsequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70s cinema edward g robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and theres a great but too modest supportive role for joseph cotton \""baron blood\"" \""the abominable dr phibes\"" this is science-fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! no fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet""","soylent green one best disturb science fiction movie 70 still persuasive even today standard although flaw little date apocalyptic touch environmental premise typical time still feel unsettle thoughtprovoking film qualitylevel surpass majority contemporary sf flick strong cast intense sequence personally consider classic new york 2022 depress place alive overpopulation unemployment unhealthy climate total scarcity every vital food product form food available synthetic distribute soylent company charlton heston great shape play cop investigate murder one soylents eminent executive stumble upon scandal dark secret script little oversentimental time climax doesnt really come big surprise still atmosphere tense uncanny riotsequence truly grueling easily one macabre moment 70 cinema edward g robinson ultimately impressive last role great modest supportive role joseph cotton \""baron blood\"" \""the abominable dr phibes\"" science-fiction book: nightmarish inevitable fade humanity! fancy space-ships hairy monster attack planet""",NN NN VBZ CD IN DT JJS CC RBS VBG NN NN NNS IN DT NNS CC RB RB JJ RB IN NNS NNS IN JJ CC DT JJ JJ DT JJ NN CC DT JJ NN JJ IN DT NN RB VBP RB JJ CC VBG DT NNS NN VBZ DT NN IN JJ PRP$ NNS IN IN PRP$ JJ NN CC DT JJ NNS WDT PRP RB VBP JJ DT JJ NN IN CD VBZ DT JJ NN TO VB JJ IN NN NN DT JJ NN CC DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN NN DT JJ NN IN NN JJ VBZ JJ CC VBN IN DT NN NN NN NN IN DT JJ NN VBZ DT NN VBG DT NN IN CD IN NNS RBS JJ NNS CC PRP VBZ IN NNS CC JJ NNS DT NN VBZ DT JJ JJ IN NNS CC DT NN VBZ RB RB VB IN DT JJ NN RB DT NN VBZ RB JJ CC JJ DT NN VBZ RB VBG CC RB CD IN DT RBS JJ NNS IN NNS FW NN DT NN VBZ RB JJ IN PRP$ JJ NN CC EX VBZ DT JJ CC RB JJ JJ NN IN NN NN NN NN `` DT JJ FW VB `` DT VBZ NN HYPH NN IN PRP$ NN : DT JJ CC JJ NN IN NN .

21,21,"Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality. He has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that's when he loses it. He believes that when women actually have sex that's when they lose any sense of \innocence\"" and/or \""beauty\"". So he strolls through the Hollywood Hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance, ultimately shooting the men dead with a high-powered rifle with a scope.<br /><br />The seeming primary reason for this movie's existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again. The \""story\"" comes off as more of an afterthought. This is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we're treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity (the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes) and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation. Of course, seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism. (For one thing, Mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger.) This is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack.<br /><br />Those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another. It even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds Mike and renders him uncertain *how* to react. It unfolds at a very slow pace, but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist.

22,22,"This happy-go-luck 1939 military swashbuckler, based rather loosely on Rudyard Kipling's memorable poem as well as his novel \Soldiers Three,\"" qualifies as first-rate entertainment about the British Imperial Army in India in the 1880s. Cary Grant delivers more knock-about blows with his knuckled-up fists than he did in all of his movies put together. Set in faraway India, this six-fisted yarn dwells on the exploits of three rugged British sergeants and their native water bearer Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) who contend with a bloodthirsty cult of murderous Indians called the Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant of \""The Last Outpost\""), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar-winner Victor McLaglen of \""The Informer\""), and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. of \""The Dawn Patrol\""), are a competitive trio of hard-drinking, hard-brawling, and fun-loving Alpha males whose years of frolic are about to become history because Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the tea business. Naturally, Cutter and MacChesney drum up assorted schemes to derail Ballentine's plans. When their superiors order them back into action with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote of \""The Sheik Steps Out\""), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham so that he cannot accompany them and Ballantine has to replace him. Half of the fun here is watching the principals trying to outwit each other without hating themselves. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in grand style and scope as our heroes tangle with an army of Thuggees. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for his outstanding black & white cinematography.""",1,"this happygoluck 1939 military swashbuckler based rather loosely on rudyard kiplings memorable poem as well

27,27,"What the ........... is this ? This must, without a doubt, be the biggest waste of film, settings and camera ever. I know you can't set your expectations for an 80's slasher high, but this is too stupid to be true. I baught this film for 0.89$ and I still feel the urge to go claim my money back. Can you imagine who hard it STINKS ?<br /><br />Who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations??? Well actually, you couldn't possible care less. And why should you? The makers of this piece of garbage sure didn't care. They didn't try to create a tiny bit of tension. The director ( Stephen Carpenter -- I guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that ) also made the Kindred (1986) wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did Soul Survivors. Complete crap as well, but at least that one had Eliza Dushku. This junk has the debut of Daphne Zuniga !!! ( Who ?? ) Yeah that's right, the Melrose Place chick. Her very memorable character dies about 15 min. after the opening credits. She's the second person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares ? The rest of the actors...they don't deserve the term actors actually, are completely uninteresting.

28,28,"Intrigued by the synopsis (every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign) I purchased BEN AND ARTHUR without knowing a thing about it. This is my second (and I assure you it will be my last) purchase of a CULTURE Q CONNECTION video. As far as I am concerned, this DVD is nothing but a blatant rip-off. I do not make this observation lightly  I am a major collector of videos, gay and mainstream, and I can state with some authority and without hesitation that BEN AND ARTHUR is quite simply the worst film I have ever sat through in my life. Period. My collection boasts over 1,600 films (93% on them on DVD) and of those, well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed. I hardly own every gay movie ever made, but I am comfortable in stating that I pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released, and very often I buy videos without knowing anything about the film. Sometimes, this makes for a pleasant surprise - Aimee & Jaguar, It's In The Water, Urbania and Normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that I stumbled upon accidentally. So when I read on the box that BEN AND ARTHUR concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the Christian Right, one of my favorite subjects, I decided to take the plunge sight unseen, despite my previously disappointing purchase of another CULTURE Q CONNECTION title, VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS. That film was pretty bad, but compared to BEN AND ARTHUR, it viewed like GONE WITH THE WIND. So what was so wrong with BEN AND ARTHUR? Plenty! To begin with, the \plot\"" such as it was, was totally ridiculous. This film almost made me sympathetic to the Christian Right  we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay, but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls (like this even makes sense). The writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all, and several plot points reflect no logic, follow-up or connection to the story. Murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist / right wing conflict on both sides, and the acting is so bad that it's difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired. The characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay - and nelly stereotypes to boot; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting. This film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever, and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves. The only advantage this picture has over my other CULTURE Q Connection purchase, VISIONS OF SUGARPLAMS, is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue. Hardly a distinction, since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is. It is an embarrassment to Queer culture, and I intend to warn everyone I possibly can before they waste their money on it. At $9.95 this film would have been way overpriced; I understand that it's soon to be re-priced under $20, which is STILL highway robbery. I paid the original price of $29.95, and I never felt more cheated in my life. The only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews  I have seen \""user reviews\"" for this film on numerous websites, and there is always one or two that \""praise\"" the director / writer / actor in such a way that it's obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this Ed Wood wannabe. How sad. How desperate. I just wish IMDb would allow you to assign zero stars - or even minus zero. If ever a film deserved it, this is it.""",0,"intrigued by the synopsis every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign i purchased ben and arthur without knowing a thing about it this is my second and i assure you it will be my last purchase of a culture q connection video as far as i am concerned this dvd is nothing but a blatant ripoff i do not make this observation lightly  i am a major collector of videos gay and mainstream and i can state with some authority and without hesitation that ben and arthur is quite simply the worst film i have ever sat through in my life period my collection boasts over 1600 films 93 on them on dvd and of those well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed i hardly own every gay movie ever made but i am comfortable in stating that i pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released and very often i buy videos without knowing anything about the film sometimes this makes for a pleasant surprise  aimee  jaguar its in the water urbania and normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that i stumbled upon accidentally so when i read on the box that ben and arthur concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the christian right one of my favorite subjects i decided to take the plunge sight unseen despite my previously disappointing purchase of another culture q connection title visions of sugar plums that film was pretty bad but compared to ben and arthur it viewed like gone with the wind so what was so wrong with ben and arthur?

32,32,"Faithful adaptation of witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer (or something), relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that. Downbeat (in a petit-bourgeois sort of way), philosophical and blackly humorous, the best way I could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual Charles Bukowski (no disrespect to CB intended).

33,33,"Eva (Hedy Lamarr) has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon, she realizes that her husband does not desire her. Her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love, makes Eva returning to her father's home in a farm, leaving her husband. One afternoon, while bathing in a lake, her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to Eva. They fall in love for each other and become lovers. Later, her husband misses her and tries to have Eva back home. Eva refuses, and fortune leads the trio to the same place, ending the affair in a tragic way. I have just watched \Extase\"" for the first time, and the first remark I have is relative to the horrible quality of the VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network: the movie has only 75 minutes running time, and it seems that it was used different reels of film. There are some parts totally damaged, and other parts very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images in not achieved by the Brazilian viewer, if he has a chance to find this rare VHS in a rental or for sale. The film is practically a silent movie, the story is very dated and has only a few lines. Consequently, the characters are badly developed. However, this movie is also very daring, with the exposure of Hedy Lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers, symbolizing the intercourse between Eva and her lover. The way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of Eva is very clear. The non-conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie. I liked this movie, but I hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \""Êxtase\"" (\""Ecstasy\"")""",1,"eva hedy lamarr has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not

34,34,"Even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it's still an awful film. If one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke.....first off, Jeroen Krabbé is i guess the poor man's Gerard Depardieu.....naturally i hate Gerard Depardieu even though he was very funny in the 'Iron Mask' three musketeer one. Otherwise to me he is box office poison and Jeroen Krabbé is worse than that. The poor man's box office poison....really that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised. If the '4th Man' is supposed to be some sort of critique of the Bourgeoisie....what am i saying? it isn't. Let's just say hypothetically, if it was supposed to be, it wasn't sharp enough. Satire is a tricky thing....if it isn't sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead......i think that is what happened. The story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either.....(for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any Luis Bunuel film....very sharp satire)<br /><br />[potential spoiler alert]<br /><br />Really, the blow job in the cemetery that Jeroen Krabbé's character works so so hard to attain.... do you even care? is it funny? since Mr. Voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control.....though i'm guessing he didn't cast Jeroen Krabbé because he's the worst actor and every character he's played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass.... except he's incompetent at it. So it becomes like a weird caricature. Do you think Mr. Voerhoven did that on purpose? and Jeroen Krabbé is the butt of the joke as well? I just don't see it...... So you understand the dilemma i'm faced with here right? It is the worst film ever because he's supposed to be a good director. So there is some kind of dupery involved. I knew 'Patch Adams' was horrible without even seeing it. Do not be duped by 'The 4th Man\s deceptively alluring packaging or mr. Voerhoven's reputation as a good director etc. etc.""",0,"even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics its still an awful film if one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good jokefirst off jeroen krabbé is i guess the poor mans gerard depardieunaturally i hate gerard depardieu even though he was very funny in the iron mask three musketeer one otherwise to me he is box office poison and jeroen krabbé is worse than that the poor mans box office poisonreally that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised if the 4th man is supposed to be some sort of critique of the bourgeoisiewhat am i saying it isnt lets just say hypothetically if it was supposed to be it wasnt sharp enough satire is a tricky thingif it isnt sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke insteadi think that is what happened the story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way eitherfor a more interesting and worthwhile application see any luis bunuel filmvery sharp satirebr br [potential spoiler alert]br br really the blow job in the cemetery that jeroen krabbés character works so so hard to attain do you even care? is it funny? since mr voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of controlthough im guessing he didnt cast jeroen krabbé because hes the worst actor and every character hes played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass except hes incompetent at it so it becomes like a weird caricature do you think mr voerhoven did that on purpose? and jeroen krabbé is the butt of the joke as well? i just dont see it so you understand the dilemma im faced with here right? it is the worst film ever because hes supposed to be a good director so there is some kind of dupery involved i knew patch adams was horrible without even seeing it do not be duped by the 4th man\s deceptively alluring packaging or mr voerhovens reputation as a good director etc etc""","even film wa allegedly joke response critic still awful film one go commit sort thing least make good jokefirst jeroen krabbé guess poor man gerard depardieunaturally hate gerard depardieu even though wa funny iron mask three musketeer one otherwise box office poison jeroen krabbé worse poor man box office poisonreally fair economically disenfranchise 4th man suppose sort critique bourgeoisiewhat say isnt let say hypothetically wa suppose wasnt sharp enough satire tricky thingif isnt sharp enough viewer become butt joke insteadi think happen story end bunch miserable disgust character nothing anyone would care interest way eitherfor interest worthwhile application see luis bunuel filmvery sharp satirebr br [potential spoiler alert]br br really blow job cemetery jeroen krabbés character work hard attain even care? funny? since mr voerhoven suppose good film maker give benefit doubt assume wa misanthropic joke get controlthough im guess didnt cast jeroen krabbé worst actor every character play ha pretentious bourgeois except incompetent become like weird caricature think mr voerhoven purpose? jeroen krabbé butt joke well? dont see understand dilemma im face right? worst film ever suppose good director kind dupery involve know patch adam wa horrible without even see dupe 4th man\s deceptively allure package mr voerhovens reputation good director etc etc""",RB IN DT NN VBD RB DT NN IN NN IN NNS PRP$ RB DT JJ NN IN PRP VBZ VBG TO VB IN DT NN IN NN IN JJS VB PRP DT JJ NN IN NN NN VBZ PRP VBP DT JJ NNS VBP RB PRP VBP NN NN RB IN PRP VBD RB JJ IN DT NN VB CD NN CD RB IN PRP PRP VBZ NN NN NN CC NN NN VBZ JJR IN IN DT JJ NNS NN NN RB WDT VBZ RB VBG JJ IN DT RB VBN IN DT JJ NN VBZ VBN TO VB DT NN IN NN IN DT WDT VBP PRP VBG PRP VBZ RB NNS RB VB RB IN PRP VBD VBN TO VB PRP VBD RB JJ JJ NN VBZ DT JJ NN PRP VBZ RB JJ JJ DT NN VBZ DT NN IN DT NN NN VB DT VBZ WP VBD DT NN RB VBZ RP IN DT NN IN JJ JJ NNS VBG NN IN NN MD VB IN CC RB IN DT JJ NN IN DT RBR JJ CC JJ NN VBP DT JJ NN NN JJ NN NN -LRB- JJ NN NNP VBZ RB DT NN NN IN DT NN WDT JJ JJ NN VBZ RB RB JJ TO VB VB PRP RB VB .

The three main performers are pitiful. Jude Law (also in the other movie I wanted to walk out on) is just awful in the title role.

38,38,"I found this movie quite by accident, but am happy that I did. Kenneth Branagh's performance came close to stealing this movie from Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie. This movie brought to mind the excellent movies that Branagh made with Emma Thompson. Carter's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as I have seen from a female lead in a long time. Portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off, but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life, she made it so believable. If this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women \uglying\"" themselves up for roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I fell sure Carter would have had strong consideration for an Oscar. If you run across this movie on cable late at night as I did, trust me, it is worth the lost sleep.""",1,i found this movie quite by accident but am happy that i did kenneth branaghs performance came close to stealing this movie from helena bonham carter but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie this movie brought to mind the excellent movies that branagh made with emma thompson carters star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as i have seen from a female lead in a long time portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life she made it so believable if this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women uglying themselves up for roles charlize theron halle berry i fell sure carter would have had strong consideration for an oscar if you run across this movie on cable late at night as i did trust me it is worth the lost sleep,find movie quite accident happy kenneth branaghs performance come close steal movie helena bonham carter strong chemistry together make much enjoyable movie movie bring mind excellent movie branagh make emma thompson carter star turn disable young woman seek complete wa good performance see female lead long time portray disable person hard pull basically eye show pain situation life make believable movie come current wave movie beautiful woman uglying role charlize theron halle berry fell sure carter would strong consideration oscar run across movie cable late night trust worth lose sleep,PRP VBD DT NN RB IN NN CC VBP JJ IN PRP VBD JJ NNS NN VBD RB IN VBG DT NN IN FW JJ NN CC PRP$ JJ NN RB VBD IN DT RB RBR JJ NN DT NN VBD TO VB DT JJ NNS WDT VBP VBN IN NN NN NNS NN NN RB IN DT JJ JJ NNS VBG TO VB PRP VBD RB JJ DT NN IN PRP VBP VBN IN DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN VBG DT JJ NN VBZ JJ TO VB RP CC IN RB RB PRP$ NNS TO VB PRP$ NN IN PRP$ NN IN NN PRP VBD PRP RB JJ IN DT NN VBD VBN RP IN DT JJ NN IN NNS IN JJ NNS VBG PRP RP IN NNS VBP NN NN NN PRP VBD JJ NN MD VB VBN JJ NN IN DT NN IN PRP VBP IN DT NN IN NN RB IN NN IN PRP VBD VB PRP PRP VBZ JJ DT JJ NN,PRON VERB DET NOUN ADV ADP NOUN CCONJ VERB ADJ ADP PRON VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB ADV ADP VERB DET NOUN ADP X ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADJ ADJ NOUN ADV VERB ADP DET ADV ADV ADJ NOUN DET NOUN VERB PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADJ VERB VERB ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN ADV ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB PART VERB PRON VERB ADV ADJ DET NOUN ADP PRON VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ PART VERB PART CCONJ ADP ADV ADV ADJ NOUN PART VERB ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PRON VERB PRON ADV ADJ ADP DET NOUN VERB VERB PART ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN VERB PRON PART ADP NOUN VERB NOUN NOUN NOUN PRON VERB ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADV ADP NOUN ADP PRON VERB VERB PRON PRON VERB ADJ DET ADJ NOUN,nsubj ROOT det dobj advmod prep pobj cc conj acomp mark nsubj aux amod compound nsubj ccomp advmod prep pcomp det dobj prep compound compound pobj cc poss amod conj advmod acl prep det advmod advmod amod pobj det nsubj relcl aux advcl det amod dobj nsubj relcl xcomp prep compound compound compound pobj conj advmod prep det amod amod pobj acl aux xcomp dobj ccomp advmod amod det attr mark nsubj aux advcl prep det amod pobj prep det amod pobj acl det amod dobj advcl acomp aux xcomp prt cc conj advmod advmod poss pobj aux advcl poss dobj prep poss pobj prep pobj nsubj ROOT nsubj advmod ccomp mark det nsubj aux advcl prt prep det amod pobj prep pobj prep amod pobj acl dobj prt prep compound pobj amod compound dobj nsubj ROOT oprd nsubj aux aux ccomp amod dobj prep det pobj mark nsubj advcl prep det pobj prep pobj advmod prep pobj mark nsubj aux advcl dobj nsubj ROOT acomp det amod attr,TIME,PRP-VBD VBD-DT DT-NN NN-RB RB-IN IN-NN NN-CC CC-VBP VBP-JJ JJ-IN IN-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-JJ JJ-NNS NNS-NN NN-VBD VBD-RB RB-IN IN-VBG VBG-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-FW FW-JJ JJ-NN NN-CC CC-PRP$ PRP$-JJ JJ-NN NN-RB RB-VBD VBD-IN IN-DT DT-RB RB-RBR RBR-JJ JJ-NN NN-DT DT-NN NN-VBD VBD-TO TO-VB VB-DT DT-JJ JJ-NNS NNS-WDT WDT-VBP VBP-VBN VBN-IN IN-NN NN-NN NN-NNS NNS-NN NN-NN NN-RB RB-IN IN-DT DT-JJ JJ-JJ JJ-NNS NNS-VBG VBG-TO TO-VB VB-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-RB RB-JJ JJ-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-PRP PRP-VBP VBP-VBN VBN-IN IN-DT DT-JJ JJ-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-JJ JJ-NN NN-VBG VBG-DT DT-JJ JJ-NN NN-VBZ VBZ-JJ JJ-TO TO-VB VB-RP RP-CC CC-IN IN-RB RB-RB RB-PRP$ PRP$-NNS NNS-TO TO-VB VB-PRP$ PRP$-NN NN-IN IN-PRP$ PRP$-NN NN-IN IN-NN NN-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-PRP PRP-RB RB-JJ JJ-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-VBD VBD-VBN VBN-RP RP-IN IN-DT DT-JJ JJ-NN NN-IN IN-NNS NNS-IN IN-JJ JJ-NNS NNS-VBG VBG-PRP PRP-RP RP-IN IN-NNS NNS-VBP VBP-NN NN-NN NN-NN NN-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-JJ JJ-NN NN-MD MD-VB VB-VBN VBN-JJ JJ-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-PRP PRP-VBP VBP-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-NN NN-RB RB-IN IN-NN NN-IN IN-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-VB VB-PRP PRP-PRP PRP-VBZ VBZ-JJ JJ-DT DT-JJ JJ-NN
39,39,"I'll dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic New Yorker persona, because quite frankly, to draw comparisons with bumbling loser Josh Kornbluth, is just an insult to any such director. I will also avoid mentioning the spot-on satire `Office Space' in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe. I can, however, compare it to waking up during your own surgery  it's painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what they're doing. Haiku Tunnel is the kind of film you wish they'd pulled the plug on in its early stages of production. It was cruel to let it live and as a result, audiences around the world are being made to suffer.<br /><br />The film's premise  if indeed it has one  is not even worth discussing, but for the sake of caution I will. Josh Kornbluth, a temp worker with severe commitment-phobia, is offered a permanent job. His main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss. But ludicrously, he is unable to perform this simple task. My reaction? Big deal! That's not a story it's a passing thought at best - one that should've passed any self-respecting filmmaker by. <br /><br />The leading actor  if you can call him that  is a clumsy buffoon of a man, with chubby features, a receding, untamed hairline, and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe-making to plain disturbing. Where o where did the director find this schmuck? What's that you say he is the director? Oh, my mistake. Playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing, but I suspect that Mr Kornbluth isn't that convincing as a human being, let alone an actor. Rest assured, this is by no means an aimless character assassination, but never before have I been so riled up by an actor's on-screen presence! My frustration was further confounded by his incessant to-camera monologues in between scenes. I mean, as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel, Kornbluth insults us further by `explaining' the action (first rule of filmmaking: `dramatize exposition' show, don't tell). Who does this guy think he is? He has no charisma, no charm, and judging by his Hawaiian shirts, no sense of style. His casting agent should be shot point blank!<br /><br />The supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom I felt, with but one exception. Patricia Scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as Helen the ex-secretary, who has been driven insane by her old boss, and makes harassing phone calls from her basement, while holding a flashlight under her face. This did make me chuckle to myself, but the moment soon passed and I was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film.<br /><br />The film's title is also a misnomer. Haiku Tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry. Don't be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious-sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office there's a very good reason for that!<br /><br />",0,ill dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic new yorker persona because quite frankly to draw comparisons with bumbling loser josh kornbluth is just an insult to any such director i will also avoid mentioning the spoton satire office space in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe i can however compare it to waking up during your own surgery  its painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what theyre doing haiku tunnel is the kind of film you wish theyd pulled the plug on in its early stages of production it was cruel to let it live and as a result audiences around the world are being made to sufferbr br the films premise  if indeed it has one  is not even worth discussing but for the sake of caution i will josh kornbluth a temp worker with severe commitmentphobia is offered a permanent job his main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss but ludicrously he is unable to perform this simple task my reaction?

40,40,"At first sight this movie doesn't look like a particular great one. After all a Bette Davis movies with only 166 votes on IMDb and a rating of 6,5 must be a rather bad one. But the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise.<br /><br />You would at first expect that this is a normal average typical '30's movie with a formulaic love-story but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story, which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watch.<br /><br />The story is carried by its two main characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent.

44,44,"I just watched this movie on Starz. Let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved; the acting, writing, directing, special effects, camera crew, sound, and lighting. It also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie. Apparently back in 2007, when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $75 million. Now-a-days those things cost about $3 billion and they cant go invisible. Apparently you can fly from the US to the middle east in an hour.

It turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks.<br /><br />So, its like 10 years later, and the group of friends who hurt Marty start getting High School reunion letters. But...they are the only ones receiving them! So they return back to the old school, and one by one get knocked off by.......Yeah you probably know what happens!<br /><br />The only part that disappointed me was the very end. It could have been left off, or thought out better.<br /><br />I think you should give it a try, and try not to be to critical!<br /><br />~*~CupidGrl~*~",1,okay sorry but i loved this movie i just love the whole 80s genre of these kind of movies because you dont see many like this one anymore i want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a ripoff or a cheesy imitation what is it imitating ive never seen another movie like this one well not horror anywaybr br basically its about the popular group in school who like to make everyones lives living hell so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named marty it turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranksbr br so its like 10 years later and the group of friends who hurt marty start getting high school reunion letters butthey are the only ones receiving them! so they return back to the old school and one by one get knocked off byyeah you probably know what happens!br br the only part that disappointed me was the very end it could have been left off or thought out betterbr br i think you should give it a try and try not to be to critical!br br ~*~cupidgrl~*~,okay sorry love movie love whole 80 genre kind movie dont see many like one anymore want ask people say movie ripoff cheesy imitation imitate ive never see another movie like one well horror anywaybr br basically popular group school like make everyones life live hell decide pick nerdy boy name marty turn fatal really get hurt one little pranksbr br like 10 year later group friend hurt marty start get high school reunion letter butthey one receive them! return back old school one one get knock byyeah probably know happens!br br part disappoint wa end could leave think betterbr br think give try try critical!br br ~*~cupidgrl~*~,"UH UH CC PRP VBD DT NN PRP RB VBP DT JJ NNS NN IN DT NN IN NNS IN PRP VBP RB VB JJ IN DT NN RB PRP VBP TO VB DT IN PRP NNS WP VBP DT NN VBZ RB DT NN CC DT NN NN WP VBZ PRP VBG PRP VB RB VBN DT NN IN DT NN UH RB NN NN NN RB PRP$ IN DT JJ NN IN NN WP VBP TO VB NNS NNS VBG NN RB PRP VBD TO VB IN DT JJ NN VBD NN PRP VBZ JJ WRB PRP RB VBZ VBN IN CD IN PRP$ JJ NN NN RB PRP$ UH CD NNS RB CC DT NN IN NNS WP VBP NN VBP VBG JJ NN NN NNS PRP VBP DT JJ NNS VBG PRP .

50,50,"Stephane Rideau was already a star for his tour de force in \Wild Reeds,\"" and he is one of France's biggest indie stars. In this film, he plays Cedric, a local boy who meets vacationing Mathieu (newcomer Jamie Elkaim, in a stunning, nuanced, ethereal performance) at the beach. Mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother, demanding aunt and sister (with whom he has a competitive relationship). Soon, the two are falling in love.<br /><br />The film's fractured narrative -- which is comprised of lengthy flash-backs, bits and pieces of the present, and real-time forward-movement into the future -- is a little daunting. Director Sebastien Lifshitz doesn't signal which time-period we are in, and the story line can be difficult to follow. But stick it out: The film's final 45 minutes are so engrossing that you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen.

52,52,"Yikes. This is pretty bad. The play isn't great to begin with, and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours - especially as Peploe doesn't decide how she wants to treat the material's theatrical origins (we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc.) and has decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that you're watching a film, whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material. Mira Sorvino's central performance is breath-takingly poor: stage-y and plummy, it's as if she's playing the part via Helena Bonham-Carter's Merchant Ivory oeuvre. Only Fiona Shaw delivers a performance of note - and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material - but it's hard to watch a film for one performance alone, even if that performance is as light, truthful and entire as Shaw's. Ben Kingsley turns in an average and disengaged turn, and Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling plays her supporting role as just that. Sadly, none of Bertolucci's magic has rubbed off on his wife if this film is to be the evidence.",0,yikes this is pretty bad the play isnt great to begin with and the decision to transfer it to film

53,53,"Last week, I took a look at the weekly Nielsen ratings, and there was Veronica Mars, supposedly \the best show you're not watching\"".<br /><br />Well, they're right that you're not watching it. It aired twice and was ranked 147 and 145 out of 147.<br /><br />Translation: this is the lowest-rated show on any nationally broadcast network... and deservedly so.

Written by the superb Tom Pettit, and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other, and their tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning. Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters.

Turns out, the Judge made the arrangements for the hit-man, because she was divorcing the judge, and threatening to take all his money. This is all known within the first ten minutes, so nothing is being given away. After the hit, the cops locate the hit-man pretty fast, but in trying to arrest him, several police officers and civilians are killed. He eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy, before he escapes back to Cambodia. This is a movie that never stops, and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many cops are killed, as the hit-man proves very very hard to track, and take down when they do locate him. Along the way, the hit-man in trying to hide in a dump, finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man. He helps her, and saves her from the guy, and she persuades the hit-man to take her along with him in his escape. I loved this movie, it's like a roller-coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed, as one incident leads to another, and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit-man. The acting is exceptionally good, and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking. There's no let up in this movie, not even with the very very incredible ending. The ending is pretty much unbelievable, and also a fitting end to all the action and violence. Yes, the violence is brutal at times, but this is a very no nonsense crime drama, that will knock your socks off. \Dog Eat Dog\"" definitely needs a more widespread release, including an R1 release for sure. Great movie, highly recommended.""",1,"as i understand it after the chinese took over hong kong the infamous cat 3 hong kong movies kind of disappeared at least until now and what an amazing movie

60,60,"Yes, this IS a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun! That's because although the film clearly was horror, some of the stories had a light spirit--and there were even occasionally a few laughs. This isn't at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious. Because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good, it's one of the better movies of this style I have seen.<br /><br />The unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself. Four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenants.<br /><br />The first segment starred Denholm Elliott as a horror writer who has writer's block. So, for a change of scenery, they rent this house. Almost immediately Elliott's block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer. Amazingly, soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character! Again and again, the psychotic killer appears and then disappears--making it seem as if he is losing his mind. This might just be the best of the stories, as the nice twist ending makes the story come alive.<br /><br />The second, while not bad at all, is probably the weakest. Peter Cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago (though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary). When he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town, he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this. Later, a friend (Joss Ackland) visits and he, too, sees the figure and is entranced by it. This all leads to an ending that, frankly, was a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />Christopher Lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl. During most of this segment, Lee seemed like an idiot, but in the end you can understand his demeanor. Though slow, this one ended very well.<br /><br />The fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre. Jon Pertwee (the third \Doctor\"" from the DR. WHO television series) is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of Dracula. However, nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique, he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film. It's actually pretty interesting that he played this role, as it seemed like a natural for Christopher Lee who played Dracula or other vampires a bazillion times (give or take a few). I enjoyed Pertwee's line when he basically said that Lee's and other recent incarnations of Dracula were all crap compared to Bela Lugosi's! Perhaps this is why Lee didn't take this part! Despite some very silly moments, it was very entertaining and fun--possibly as good or better than the first segment.<br /><br />Considering that the film started and ended so well, had excellent acting and writing, it's hard not to like this film.""",1,"yes this is a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun thats because although the film clearly was horror some of the stories had a light spiritand there were even occasionally a few laughs this isnt at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good its one of the better movies of this style i have seenbr br the unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenantsbr br the first segment starred denholm elliott as a horror writer who has writers block so for a change of scenery they rent this house almost immediately elliotts block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer amazingly soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character!

61,61,"A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, cats and death soon follow them. That about sums it up.<br /><br />I'll admit that I am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie. But in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film, and believe me there is plenty of that to go around, it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />The characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on. Fear, greed, pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people. Although it can be argued that that seeming failing, in actuality, serves the telling of the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work, makeup and quite suitable music. The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother.<br /><br />King manages to take a simple story of outsider, or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case), trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan.",0,a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town cats and death soon follow them that about sums it upbr br ill admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film and believe me there is plenty of that to go around it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experiencebr br the characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on fear greed pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people although it can be argued that that seeming failing in actuality serves the telling of the story the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplaynot that i have anything specific against mr king are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work makeup and quite suitable music the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady the otherworldly motherbr br king manages to take a simple story of outsider or people who are a little differentokay -

62,62,"I rented this movie because it falls under the genres of \romance\"" and \""western\"" with some Grand Canyon scenery thrown in. But if you're expecting a typical wholesome romantic western, forget it. This movie is pure trash! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN! The child is also lusted after by other leering men. It's sickening.<br /><br />Peter Fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship. He tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy, loving couple.

Yes thats right, they use records in this movie. In one scene Eddie (Skippy) is listening to a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things begin to get scary. Monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed. As a teenager I tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine.

64,64,"IT IS So Sad. Even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like Blood Lake, There's Nothing Out There & . The music they play in this is the funniest stuff i've ever heard. i like the brother and sister in this movie.

66,66,"WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (but not really - keep reading). Ahhh, there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that I won't have room to list them all. The opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills; an enchanting Peres 'Prez' Prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited (but his grunts are unmistakable, and no-one else did them); and with familiar cast names, including Kathy Najimi a full year before she hit with Sister Acts 1 & 2 plus Teri Hatcher from TV's Superman.<br /><br />Every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors, actresses and producers in daytime TV. Peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old-fashioned, delicious farce. Robert Harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of MAD Magazine, but feels like a gift to us in the audience. Some of the cliched characters are a bit dim, but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy, especially against Celeste Talbert (Sally Field) who is the show's perennial award-winning lead, nicknamed \America's Sweetheart\"". The daytime Emmies-like awards opening does introduce us to Celeste's show, The Sun Also Sets. Against all vain fears to the contrary, Celeste wins again. She is overjoyed, because it's always \""such a genuine thrill\"": \""Adam, did you watch? I won! Well, nguh...\"" The reason for Adam's absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot, and we're instantly off on a trip with Celeste's neuroses. She cries, screeches, and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser Tawnee (Kathy Najimi, constantly waddling after Celeste, unseen through Celeste's fog of paranoia) indulges a taste for Tammy Faye Baker, for which Tawnee had been in fact specifically hired.<br /><br />Rosie Schwartz (Whoopi Goldberg) has seen it all before. She is the head writer of the show, and she and Celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for 15 years. So when Celeste freaks, Rosie offers to write her off the show for six months: \""We'll just say that Maggie went to visit with the Dalai Lama.\"" But Celeste has doubts: \""I thought that the Dalai Lama moved to LA.\"" \""-Well, then, some other lama, Fernando Lamas, come on!\"". Such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor Lorenzo Lamas, son of aforementioned Fernando Lamas (d. 1982).<br /><br />Those who can remember the economics teacher (Ben Stein) in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) as he deadeningly calls the roll (\""Bueller. Bueller. Bueller\""), will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer. Other well hidden member of the cast include Garry Marshall (in real life Mr Happy Days and brother of Penny), who \""gets paid $1.2 million to make the command decisions\"" on The Sun Also Sets - he says he definitely likes \""peppy and cheap\""; and Carrie Fisher as Betsy Faye Sharon, who's \""a bitch\"".<br /><br />Geoffrey Anderson (Kevin Kline) is the \""yummy-with-a-spoon\"" (and he is, by the way) dinner theater actor now rescued from his Hell by David Seaton Barnes (Robert Downey Jr), and brought back to the same show he was canned from 20 years earlier. Of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character, Rod Randall, was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago. Somehow they work out the logical difficulties, and Geoffrey Anderson steps off the choo-choo.<br /><br />Celeste can now only get worse, and her trick of going across the Washington bridge no longer helps. First, her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara, but she soon degenerates into a stalker. Unfortunately, she cannot get rid of Geoffrey Anderson so easily. Geoffrey's been promised development of his one-man play about Hamlet, and he means to hold the producer to that promise. \""I'm not going back to Florida no-how!\"", argues Geoffrey. \""You try playing Willie Loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf !\"" And indeed, seeing Geoffrey's dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious. Back in Florida in his Willie Loman fat suit in his room, Geoffrey Anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as \""Mr Loman\"". He was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his TV with a shoe, and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer. Now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating Laurie Craven, the show's new ingenue; so he's not leaving.<br /><br />Beautiful Elizabeth Shue (as Laurie) rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well. But, of course, the course to true love never did run smoothly. Montana Moorehead (Cathy Moriarty) is getting impatient waiting for her star to rise, and is getting desperate for some publicity.<br /><br />Will her plots finally succeed? Will Celeste settle her nerves, or will she kill Tawnee first? Will the producer get Mr Fuzzy? -You'll just have to watch * the second half * of this utterly lovable, farcically malicious riot.<br /><br />And you'll really have to see to believe how the short-sighted Geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the TelePrompter. If you are not in stitches with stomach-heaving laughter and tears pouring down your face, feel free to demand your money back for the video rental. Soapdish (1991) is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again, because it's not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines. This is very well-crafted humor, almost all of it in the writing. A draw with Blazing Saddles (1974) for uproarious apoplexy value, although otherwise dissimilar. Watch it and weep. A happy source for anyone's video addiction. 10 out of 10.""",1,"warning possible spoilers but not really  keep reading ahhh there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i wont have room to list them all the opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills an enchanting peres prez prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited but his grunts are unmistakable and noone else did them and with familiar cast names including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts 1  2 plus teri hatcher from tvs supermanbr br every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors actresses and producers in daytime tv peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an oldfashioned delicious farce robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine but feels like a gift to us in the audience some of the cliched characters are a bit dim but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy especially against celeste talbert sally field who is the shows perennial award-winning lead nicknamed \americas sweetheart\"" the daytime emmies-like awards opening does introduce us to celestes show the sun also sets against all vain fears to the contrary celeste wins again she is overjoyed because its always \""such a genuine thrill\"": \""adam did you watch?

68,68,"The King of Masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship. Set in 1930s China during a time of floods, we meet Wang, an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him. When a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends Wang, he invites Wang to join their troupe. However, we learn that Wang's family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son. Learning that Wang is childless, Wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever. Taking the advice to heart, Wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son, Doggie, the ancient art of silk masks. Soon, Wang discovers a fact about Doggie that threatens the rare and dying art.<br /><br />Together, Wang and Doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it. The story is absorbing. The setting is serene and the costuming simple.

69,69,"I really wanted to like this film, but the story is ridicules. I don't want to spoil this film, - don't worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen - but here's an example of how sloppy this film was put together. The Cowboy and \Twig\"" ride up the ridge. The Cowboy has a handle bar mustache. The Cowboy and \""Twig\"" get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge. The Cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film. Sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave, in dark, on the back of a horse.<br /><br />To be fair, the acting by the four main characters is solid.""",0,i really wanted to like this film but the story is ridicules i dont want to spoil this film  dont worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen  but heres an example of how sloppy this film was put together the cowboy and twig ride up the ridge the cowboy has a handle bar mustache the cowboy and twig get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge the cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave in dark on the back of a horsebr br to be fair the acting by the four main characters is solid,really want like film story ridicule dont want spoil film  dont worry right begin know something bad go happen  example sloppy film wa put together cowboy twig ride ridge cowboy ha handle bar mustache cowboy twig get shoot race half way ridge cowboy clean shave rest film sometime gun fight ride mountain cowboy ha time shave dark back horsebr br fair act four main character solid,PRP RB VBD TO VB DT NN CC DT NN VBZ NNS PRP VBP RB VB TO VB DT NN  VBP RB VB RB IN DT NN PRP VBP NN JJ VBZ VBG TO VB  CC VBZ DT NN IN WRB JJ DT NN VBD VBN RB DT NN CC NN VB IN DT NN DT NN VBZ DT NN NN NN DT NN CC NN VBP IN DT NN IN CC VB DT NN IN DT NN DT NN VBZ JJ NN IN RP DT NN IN DT NN RB IN DT NN NN CC DT NN IN DT NN DT NN VBZ VBN NN TO VB IN NN IN DT NN IN DT NN NN TO VB JJ DT NN IN DT CD JJ NNS VBZ JJ,PRON ADV VERB PART VERB DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN VERB NOUN PRON VERB ADV VERB PART VERB DET NOUN SPACE VERB ADV VERB ADV ADP DET NOUN PRON VERB NOUN ADJ VERB VERB PART VERB SPACE CCONJ VERB DET NOUN ADP ADV ADJ DET NOUN VERB VERB ADV DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN DET NOUN VERB DET NOUN NOUN NOUN DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP CCONJ VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN DET NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN ADP PART DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADV ADP DET NOUN NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN DET NOUN VERB VERB NOUN PART VERB ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN PART VERB ADJ DET NOUN ADP DET NUM ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ,nsubj advmod ROOT aux xcomp det dobj cc det nsubj conj attr nsubj aux advmod relcl aux xcomp det dobj  aux advmod ccomp advmod prep det pobj nsubj parataxis nsubj amod aux ccomp aux xcomp  cc conj det dobj prep advmod acomp det nsubjpass auxpass pcomp advmod det nsubj cc conj advcl prt det dobj det nsubj relcl det amod compound ccomp det nsubj cc conj relcl prep det pobj prt cc conj det npadvmod prep det pobj det nsubj ROOT acomp advmod prep prep det dobj prep det pobj advmod prep det compound pobj cc det conj prep det pobj det nsubj aux conj dobj aux relcl prep pobj prep det pobj prep det compound pobj aux advcl acomp det attr prep det nummod amod pobj ccomp acomp,NORP CARDINAL CARDINAL,PRP-RB RB-VBD VBD-TO TO-VB VB-DT DT-NN NN-CC CC-DT DT-NN NN-VBZ VBZ-NNS NNS-PRP PRP-VBP VBP-RB RB-VB VB-TO TO-VB VB-DT DT-NN NN-VBP VBP-RB RB-VB VB-RB RB-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-PRP PRP-VBP VBP-NN NN-JJ JJ-VBZ VBZ-VBG VBG-TO TO-VB VB-CC CC-VBZ VBZ-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-WRB WRB-JJ JJ-DT DT-NN NN-VBD VBD-VBN VBN-RB RB-DT DT-NN NN-CC CC-NN NN-VB VB-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-DT DT-NN NN-VBZ VBZ-DT DT-NN NN-NN NN-NN NN-DT DT-NN NN-CC CC-NN NN-VBP VBP-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-CC CC-VB VB-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-DT DT-NN NN-VBZ VBZ-JJ JJ-NN NN-IN IN-RP RP-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-RB RB-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-NN NN-CC CC-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-DT DT-NN NN-VBZ VBZ-VBN VBN-NN NN-TO TO-VB VB-IN IN-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-NN NN-TO TO-VB VB-JJ JJ-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-DT DT-CD CD-JJ JJ-NNS NNS-VBZ VBZ-JJ
70,70,"I am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because I heard how interesting it was. I can honestly say it was very interesting indeed. The two lead actors are awesome, the film isn't ever boring, and the concept behind it (though obviously inspired by the Columbine killings and the home movies of the killers) is really interesting. There are some weaknesses, such as the final 20 minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesn't make any sense at all. The shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction, but in cinema verite that is a given. But I still think the movie is very well done and the director Ben Coccio deserves some credit.",1,i am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because i heard how interesting it was i can honestly say it was very interesting indeed the two lead actors are awesome the film isnt ever boring and the concept behind it though obviously inspired by the columbine killings and the home movies of the killers is really interesting there are some weaknesses such as the final 20 minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesnt make any sense at all the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction but in cinema verite that is a given but i still think the movie is very well done and the director ben coccio deserves some credit,big fan cinema verite saw movie hear interest wa honestly say wa interest indeed two lead actor awesome film isnt ever bore concept behind though obviously inspire columbine kill home movie killer really interest weakness final 20 minute really detract realism see first hour end really doesnt make sense shaky camera sometimes distraction cinema verite give still think movie well director ben coccio deserve credit,PRP VBP DT JJ NN IN NN NN CC VBD DT NN IN PRP VBD WRB JJ PRP VBD PRP MD RB VB PRP VBD RB JJ RB DT CD JJ NNS VBP JJ DT NN VBZ RB RB JJ CC DT NN IN PRP IN RB VBN IN DT NN NNS CC DT NN NNS IN DT NNS VBZ RB JJ EX VBP DT NNS JJ IN DT JJ CD NNS WDT RB VBZ IN DT NN VBN IN DT JJ NN CC RB CC DT NN RB VBZ RB VB DT NN IN PDT DT JJ NN RB MD VB DT NN CC IN NN NN WDT VBZ DT VBN CC PRP RB VBP DT NN VBZ RB RB VBN CC DT NN NN NN VBZ DT NN,PRON VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN CCONJ VERB DET NOUN ADP PRON VERB ADV ADJ PRON VERB PRON VERB ADV VERB PRON VERB ADV ADJ ADV DET NUM ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ DET NOUN VERB ADV ADV ADJ CCONJ DET NOUN ADP PRON ADP ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB ADV ADJ ADV VERB DET NOUN ADJ ADP DET ADJ NUM NOUN ADJ ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADV CCONJ DET NOUN ADV VERB ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ DET ADJ NOUN ADV VERB VERB DET NOUN CCONJ ADP NOUN NOUN ADJ VERB DET VERB CCONJ PRON ADV VERB DET NOUN VERB ADV ADV VERB CCONJ DET NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB DET NOUN,nsubj ROOT det amod attr prep compound pobj cc conj det dobj mark nsubj advcl advmod acomp nsubj ccomp nsubj aux advmod ROOT nsubj ccomp advmod acomp advmod det nummod compound nsubj ROOT acomp det nsubj conj advmod advmod acomp cc det nsubj prep pobj mark advmod acl agent det compound pobj cc det compound conj prep det pobj conj advmod acomp expl ccomp det attr amod prep det amod nummod pobj nsubj advmod relcl prep det pobj acl prep det amod pobj cc nummod cc det nsubj advmod aux advmod conj det dobj prep predet det amod pobj advmod aux advcl det attr cc prep compound pobj nsubj conj det attr cc nsubj advmod ROOT det nsubj auxpass advmod advmod ccomp cc det compound compound nsubj conj det dobj,CARDINAL TIME TIME,PRP-VBP VBP-DT DT-JJ JJ-NN NN-IN IN-NN NN-NN NN-CC CC-VBD VBD-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-WRB WRB-JJ JJ-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-PRP PRP-MD MD-RB RB-VB VB-PRP PRP-VBD VBD-RB RB-JJ JJ-RB RB-DT DT-CD CD-JJ JJ-NNS NNS-VBP VBP-JJ JJ-DT DT-NN NN-VBZ VBZ-RB RB-RB RB-JJ JJ-CC CC-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-PRP PRP-IN IN-RB RB-VBN VBN-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-NNS NNS-CC CC-DT DT-NN NN-NNS NNS-IN IN-DT DT-NNS NNS-VBZ VBZ-RB RB-JJ JJ-EX EX-VBP VBP-DT DT-NNS NNS-JJ JJ-IN IN-DT DT-JJ JJ-CD CD-NNS NNS-WDT WDT-RB RB-VBZ VBZ-IN IN-DT DT-NN NN-VBN VBN-IN IN-DT DT-JJ JJ-NN NN-CC CC-RB RB-CC CC-DT DT-NN NN-RB RB-VBZ VBZ-RB RB-VB VB-DT DT-NN NN-IN IN-PDT PDT-DT DT-JJ JJ-NN NN-RB RB-MD MD-VB VB-DT DT-NN NN-CC CC-IN IN-NN NN-NN NN-WDT WDT-VBZ VBZ-DT DT-VBN VBN-CC CC-PRP PRP-RB RB-VBP VBP-DT DT-NN NN-VBZ VBZ-RB RB-RB RB-VBN VBN-CC CC-DT DT-NN NN-NN NN-NN NN-VBZ VBZ-DT DT-NN
71,71,"How do I begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the `worst film of all time' by the `worst director of all time?' A film that could develop a cult following because it's `so bad it's good?'<br /><br />An analytical approach criticizing the film seems both pointless and part of band-wagon syndrome--let's bash freely without worry of backlash because every other human on earth is doing it, and the people who like the film like it for those flaws we'd cite.<br /><br />The film's universal poor quality goes without saying-- 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol' is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to acquire the title and keep a hold of it, but I believe this film could go the distance. IMDb doesn't allow enough words to cite all the films failures, and it be much easier to site the elements 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol' does right. Unfortunately, those moments of glory are so far buried in the shadows of this film's poorness that that's a task not worth pursuing.<br /><br />My impressions? I thought I knew what I was getting into, I had been warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this one (wish that suggestion had been cups of Vodka). Despite my low expectations, 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol' failed to entertain me even on a `make fun of the bad movie' level. Not just bad, but obnoxiously bad as though Jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetical yawn but went into overkill and shoved the poetry down our throats making it not profound but funny . .. and supposedly Jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie? Even after viewing the 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol' promotional literature, I have trouble believing Jobson's sincerity. Pointless and obnoxious till the end with a several grin/chuckle moments (all I'm sure none intentional)spiced the film, and those few elements prevented me from turning the DVD off. So bad it's good? No. It had just enough 'I can't believe this is a serious movie moments' to keep me from turning it off, and nothing more.<br /><br />Definitely a film to watch with a group of bad-movie connoisseurs. Get your own running commentary going. That would've significantly improved the experience for me. So bad it's Mike Myers commentating in his cod Scottish accent on it as it runs, to turn this whole piece of sludge into a comic farce \Ok dare ma man, pass me annuder gliss of dat wiskey\"".""",0,"how do i begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the worst film of all time by the worst director of all time a film that could develop a cult following because its so bad its goodbr br an analytical approach criticizing the film seems both pointless and part of bandwagon syndromelets bash freely without worry of backlash because every other human on earth is doing it and the people who like the film like it for those flaws wed citebr br the films universal poor quality goes without saying sixteen years of alcohol is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to acquire the title and keep a hold of it but i believe this film could go the distance imdb doesnt allow enough words to cite all the films failures and it be much easier to site the elements sixteen years of alcohol does right unfortunately those moments of glory are so far buried in the shadows of this films poorness that thats a task not worth pursuingbr br my impressions? i thought i knew what i was getting into i had been warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this one wish that suggestion had been cups of vodka despite my low expectations sixteen years of alcohol failed to entertain me even on a `make fun of the bad movie level not just bad but obnoxiously bad as though jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetical yawn but went into overkill and shoved the poetry down our throats making it not profound but funny   and supposedly jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie? even after viewing the sixteen years of alcohol promotional literature i have trouble believing jobsons sincerity pointless and obnoxious till the end with a several grinchuckle moments all im sure none intentionalspiced the film and those few elements prevented me from turning the dvd off so bad its good? no it had just enough i cant believe this is a serious movie moments to keep me from turning it off and nothing morebr br definitely a film to watch with a group of bad-movie connoisseurs get your own running commentary going that wouldve significantly improved the experience for me so bad its mike myers commentating in his cod scottish accent on it as it runs to turn this whole piece of sludge into a comic farce \ok dare ma man pass me annuder gliss of dat wiskey\""""","begin review film soon recognize worst film time worst director time film could develop cult follow bad goodbr br analytical approach criticize film seem pointless part bandwagon syndromelets bash freely without worry backlash every human earth people like film like flaw wed citebr br film universal poor quality go without say sixteen year alcohol without competition title worst film ha sink pretty low acquire title keep hold believe film could go distance imdb doesnt allow enough word cite film failure much easier site element sixteen year alcohol doe right unfortunately moment glory far bury shadow film poorness thats task worth pursuingbr br impressions? think know wa get warn drink several cup coffee sit watch one wish suggestion cup vodka despite low expectation sixteen year alcohol fail entertain even `make fun bad movie level bad obnoxiously bad though jobson intentionally try make film poetical yawn go overkill shove poetry throat make profound funny   supposedly jobson sincerely try make good movie? even view sixteen year alcohol promotional literature trouble believe jobsons sincerity pointless obnoxious till end several grinchuckle moment im sure none intentionalspiced film element prevent turn dvd bad good? enough cant believe serious movie moment keep turn nothing morebr br definitely film watch group bad-movie connoisseur get run commentary go wouldve significantly improve experience bad mike myers commentate cod scottish accent run turn whole piece sludge comic farce \ok dare man pas annuder glis dat wiskey\""""",WRB VBP PRP VB TO VB DT NN WDT MD RB VB VBN IN DT JJS NN IN DT NN IN DT JJS NN IN DT NN DT NN WDT MD VB DT NN VBG IN PRP$ RB JJ PRP$ NN IN DT JJ NN VBG DT NN VBZ DT JJ CC NN IN NN NNS VBP RB IN NN IN NN IN DT JJ NN IN NN VBZ VBG PRP CC DT NNS WP VBP DT NN IN PRP IN DT NNS PRP MD NN NN DT NNS JJ JJ NN VBZ IN VBG CD NNS IN NN VBZ RB IN NN IN NN IN JJS NN IN PRP VBZ TO VB RB RB TO VB DT NN CC VB DT NN IN PRP CC PRP VBP DT NN MD VB DT NN NNS VBZ RB VB JJ NNS TO VB PDT DT NNS NNS CC PRP VB RB JJR TO VB DT NNS CD NNS IN NN VBZ RB RB DT NNS IN NN VBP RB RB VBN IN DT NNS IN DT NNS VBP IN DT VBZ DT NN RB JJ NNS NN PRP$ NNS .

72,72,"You've been fouled and beaten up in submission by my harsh statements about \femme fatale\"" / \""guns n' gals\"" movies! Now comes another breed in disappointing rediscoveries: ninja movies! Many of these I've seen before, and let me tell you, they aren't all that's cracked up to be! They usually don't stick to the point. This, among all others, suffers from no originality! What's a ninja got to do with preventing a nuclear holocaust in Russia? And isn't this supposed to be a \""martial arts\"" movie, too? Does plenty of gunfire sound like an incredible action movie to you? Is blood the number one reason to love this to death? Will you waste some of your hard-earned cash over a lady singing in her see-through tank top?

73,73,"....as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates. Barely even reaching feature length, \Can I Do It....'Till I Need Glasses\"" is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so short that you can't believe it when you realize that THAT was supposed to be the punchline (example: the Santa Claus gag); others are so long that you can't believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up THAT punchline (example: the students' awards gag). And nearly all are directed without any artistry. Don't get me wrong: about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny (the iron / phone one is probably my favorite). There is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity that proves, yet again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is some comedic male nudity as well).

79,79,"Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy star in this \modern\"" musical that showcases MacDonald's comic abilities. Surreal 40s musical seem to be making fun of 40s fashions even as they were in current vogue. Eye-popping costumes and sets (yes B&W) add to the surreal, dreamlike quality of the entire film. Several good songs enliven the film, with the \""Twinkle in Your Eye\"" number a total highlight, including a fun jitterbug number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Also in the HUGE cast are Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys. Also to been seen in extended bit parts are Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many others.<br /><br />Great fun and nice to see the wonderful MacDonald in her jitterbug/vamp routines.

80,80,"I love this movie. My friend Marcus and I were browsing the local Hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film. We had no idea what it was going to be about, but it turned out spectacular. 2 thumbs up. I liked how the film was shot, and the actors were very funny.

81,81,"Those who are not familiar with Cassandra Peterson's alter-ego Elvira, then this is a good place to start.<br /><br />\Elvira, Mistress of the Dark\"" starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message. It seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will. Anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the place she has to go is the town of Fallwell, Massachusetts. Having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down, she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. The town residents have mixed reactions:the teens like her, the women hate her, and the men lust after her (Although trying to remain moral pillars of the community). Her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard), because he wants her cookbook. Seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock.<br /><br />The film is actually pretty funny, with Peterson a.k.a. Elvira using her \""endowments\"" and sexiness as a joke (\""And don't forget, tomorrow we're showing the head with two things... I mean the thing with two heads\""). Especially funny as Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line, but ends up looking ridiculous (The picnic scene is the perfect example). Deserves a peek (The film, not her boobs, of course).""",1,"those who are not familiar with cassandra petersons alterego elvira then this is a good place to startbr br elvira mistress of the dark

82,82,"A sequel to (actually a remake of) Disney's 1996 live-action remake of 101 Dalmations. Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) is released from prison after being \cured\"" of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (ugh!). But the \""cure\"" is broken when Cruella hears the toll of Big Ben, and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hides.<br /><br />This movie is bad on so many levels, starting with the fact that it's a \""Thanksgiving family schlock\"" movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close over-over-over-over-acts as Cruella. With all that she had to put up with in this movie -- the lame script, the endless makeup, getting baked in a cake at the end -- I hope they gave her an extremely-large paycheck.<br /><br />(Speaking of which, where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line, and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building -- as you do in the climax of this film?) Of course, the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs. They serve as the \""Macaulay Culkin's\"" of this movie, pulling all the stupid \""Home Alone\"" gags on the villains. (Biting them in the crotch, running over their hands with luggage carts, squirting them with icing, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseum.) I have to admit, the dogs were fairly good actors -- much better than the humans.<br /><br />Gerard Depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked-out French furrier. The two human \""dog lovers\"" -- rehashed from the earlier film, but with different actors -- are completely boring. When they have a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant, the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers, and their dogs at home, watching the dinner scene from \""Lady and the Tramp.\"" I thought to myself, \""Oh please, don't go there!\"" I half-expected the humans to do a satire on the \""Lady and the Tramp\"" dinner scene -- as Charlie Sheen did in \""Hot Shots: Part Deux\"" -- doing the \""spaghetti strand kiss,\"" pushing the meatball with his nose, etc.<br /><br />And don't get me started on the annoying parrot with Eric Idle's voice.<br /><br />The costumes were nominated for an Oscar, and the costumes in the movie *are* good. But they are the only good thing in the movie. The rest of it is unbearable dreck.""",0,"a sequel to actually a remake of disneys 1996 liveaction remake of 101 dalmations cruella devil glenn close is released from prison after being cured of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named dr pavlov ugh but the cure is broken when cruella hears the toll of big ben and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hidesbr br this movie is bad on so many levels starting with the fact that its a thanksgiving family schlock"" movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the disney marketing machine glenn close over-over-over-over-acts as cruella with all that she had to put up with in this movie -- the lame script the endless makeup getting baked in a cake at the end -- i hope they gave her an extremely-large paycheckbr br speaking of which where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory a bakery with a rube goldberg assembly line and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building -- as you do in the climax of this film? of course the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs they serve as the \""macaulay culkins\"" of this movie pulling all the stupid \""home alone\"" gags on the villains biting them in the crotch running over their hands with luggage carts squirting them with icing etc etc etc ad nauseum i have to admit the dogs were fairly good actors -- much better than the humansbr br gerard depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked-out french furrier the two human \""dog lovers\"" -- rehashed from the earlier film but with different actors -- are completely boring when they have a spaghetti dinner at an italian restaurant the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers and their dogs at home watching the dinner scene from \""lady and the tramp\"" i thought to myself \""oh please dont go there!\"" i half-expected the humans to do a satire on the \""lady and the tramp\"" dinner scene -- as charlie sheen did in \""hot shots: part deux\"" -- doing the \""spaghetti strand kiss\"" pushing the meatball with his nose etcbr br and dont get me started on the annoying parrot with eric idles voicebr br the costumes were nominated for an oscar and the costumes in the movie *are* good but they are the only good thing in the movie the rest of it is unbearable dreck""","sequel actually remake disney 1996 liveaction remake 101 dalmations cruella devil glenn close release prison cure obsession fur psychologist name dr pavlov ugh cure break cruella hear toll big ben go mad quest make perfect coat dalmation hidesbr br movie bad many level start fact thanksgiving family schlock"" movie design suck every last available dime disney market machine glenn close over-over-over-over-acts cruella put movie -- lame script endless makeup get bake cake end -- hope give extremely-large paycheckbr br speak world go find fur coat factory bakery rube goldberg assembly line candlelight restaurant locate within build -- climax film? course real star movie suppose dog serve \""macaulay culkins\"" movie pull stupid \""home alone\"" gag villain bite crotch run hand luggage cart squirt ice etc etc etc ad nauseum admit dog fairly good actor -- much better humansbr br gerard depardieu completely waste movie freaked-out french furrier two human \""dog lovers\"" -- rehash earlier film different actor -- completely bore spaghetti dinner italian restaurant movie cut back forth two lover dog home watch dinner scene \""lady tramp\"" think \""oh please dont go there!\"" half-expected human satire \""lady tramp\"" dinner scene -- charlie sheen \""hot shots: part deux\"" -- \""spaghetti strand kiss\"" push meatball nose etcbr br dont get start annoy parrot eric idle voicebr br costume nominate oscar costume movie *are* good good thing movie rest unbearable dreck""",DT NN TO RB DT NN IN NNS CD NN NN IN CD NNS NN NN NN NN VBZ VBN IN NN IN VBG VBN IN PRP$ NN IN NN IN DT NN VBN NN NN RB CC DT NN VBZ VBN WRB NN VBZ DT NN IN JJ NN CC PRP RB RB VBZ IN DT JJ NN TO VB PRP DT JJ NN IN IN NN NN NN DT NN VBZ JJ IN RB JJ NNS VBG IN DT NN IN PRP$ DT NN NN NN '' NN VBN TO VB DT JJ JJ NN IN IN DT NN NN NN NN JJ IN HYPH IN HYPH IN HYPH NN HYPH NNS IN NN IN DT WDT PRP VBD TO VB RP IN IN DT NN : DT JJ NN DT JJ NN VBG VBN IN DT NN IN DT NN : PRP VBP PRP VBD PRP DT RB HYPH JJ NN NN VBG IN WDT WRB IN DT NN VBP PRP VBG TO VB DT NN NN NN DT NN IN DT NN NN NN NN CC DT NN NN DT VBN IN DT JJ NN : IN PRP VBP IN DT NN IN DT NN .

84,84,"And I'm serious! Truly one of the most fantastic films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. What's so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good, but if possible better than the novel it was based on. Perhaps in the case of Lord of the Rings and Trainspotting, but it is a rare occurrence indeed. But I think that the fact that Louis Sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses, so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further. This film has many elements that make it what it is:<br /><br />1. A unique, original story with a good mix of fun and humour, but a mature edge. 2. Brilliant actors. Adults and kids alike, these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard, as sometimes happen with kids movies. 3. Breathtaking scenery. And it doesn't matter if it's real or CGI, the setting in itself is a masterpiece. I especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view. 4. A talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius. The transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book, leading up to the twists throughout the film. 5. Louis Sachar! The guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that I couldn't put it down. He makes sure that the script sticks to the book, with new bits added in to make it even better. 6. And speaking of the script! The one-liners in this are smart, funny and unpatronising. But there are also parts to make you smile, make you cry, and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more. 7. Beautiful soundtrack. There's not a song in this film that I haven't fallen for, and that's something considering I'm supposed to be a punk-rocker. The songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film. If you're going to buy the film, I recommend you buy the soundtrack too, especially for \If Only\"", which centres around the story and contains the chorus from the book.<br /><br />I do not work for the people who made Holes, by the way, I'm just a fan, plugging my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves. If you haven't seen it, do it. Now. This very instant.

85,85,"Channel surfing and caught this on LOGO. It was one of those \I have to watch this because it's so horribly bad\"" moments, like Roadhouse without the joy. The writing is atrocious; completely inane and the acting is throw-up-in-your-mouth bad.<br /><br />There's low budget and then there is the abyss which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again. I mean, the main characters go to a ski retreat in some rented house and the house is, well, ordinary which is no big deal, but they choose to show all the houseguests pouring over it like it was the Sistine Chapel. I'm sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every 10'x10' boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame. I guess they didn't learn anything from the Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see hotel room check scene)...wow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I don't buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine. If it smells like...and it looks like...well, you know the rest.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague.<br /><br />edit: Apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since I disliked this movie, I am an \""obvious hater\"" which I can only assume means I am phobic, which of course is not true. I decided to do this wacky, crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence (i.e. its refreshing to see...)<br /><br />Sure, it may be refreshing to see but that doesn't equate into a great movie, just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction. In fact, I applaud the effort. Frankly, I'd rather go listen to my Kitchens of Distinction catalogue than watch this again.""",0,"channel surfing and caught this on logo it was one of those i have to watch this because its so horribly bad moments like roadhouse without the joy the writing is atrocious completely inane and the acting is throwupinyourmouth badbr br theres low budget and then there is the abyss which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again i mean the main characters go to a ski retreat in some rented house and the house is well ordinary which is no big deal but they choose to show all the houseguests pouring over it like it was the sistine chapel im sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every 10x10 boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame i guess they didnt learn anything from the bad news bears in breaking training see hotel room check scenewow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! i dont buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine if it smells likeand it looks likewell you know the restbr br avoid like the plaguebr br edit: apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since i disliked this movie i am an \""obvious hater\"" which i can only assume means i am phobic which of course is not true i decided to do this wacky crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence ie its refreshing to seebr br sure it may be refreshing to see but that doesnt equate into a great movie just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction in fact i applaud the effort frankly id rather go listen to my kitchens of distinction catalogue than watch this again""","channel surf catch logo wa one watch horribly bad moment like roadhouse without joy write atrocious completely inane act throwupinyourmouth badbr br low budget aby epic toss never see mean main character go ski retreat rent house house well ordinary big deal choose show houseguest pour like wa sistine chapel im sorry watch 6 guy stare every 10x10 bore room futon gush lame guess didnt learn anything bad news bear break train see hotel room check scenewow toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! dont buy top anything go routine smell likeand look likewell know restbr br avoid like plaguebr br edit: apparently close mind reviewer believe since dislike movie \""obvious hater\"" assume mean phobic course true decide wacky crazy thing judge movie base actual content film mere presence ie refresh seebr br sure may refresh see doesnt equate great movie give better material work tighter direction fact applaud effort frankly id rather go listen kitchen distinction catalogue watch again""",NN NN CC VBD DT IN NN PRP VBD CD IN DT PRP VBP TO VB DT IN PRP$ RB RB JJ NNS IN NN IN DT NN DT NN VBZ JJ RB NN CC DT NN VBZ NN NN NN EX VBZ JJ NN CC RB EX VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ WRB DT NN MD VB VBN CC RB VBN IN RB PRP VBP DT JJ NNS VBP IN DT NN NN IN DT VBN NN CC DT NN VBZ RB JJ WDT VBZ DT JJ NN CC PRP VBP TO VB PDT DT NNS VBG IN PRP IN PRP VBD DT NN NN PRP VBP JJ CC VBG CD NNS VB IN DT CD NN NN IN DT NN IN PRP CC VBG VBZ JJ PRP VBP PRP VBD RB VB NN IN DT JJ NN NNS IN VBG NN VBP NN NN NN VBP DT NN . . .

86,86,"When I first saw the Romeo Division last spring my first reaction was BRILLIANT! However, on future viewings I was provided with much more than masterful film-making. This picture has a singular voice that will echo throughout the annuls of film history.<br /><br />The opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer JP Sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainment.<br /><br />Sarro truly uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us along on a ride that envelops the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become accustomed to and dives deeply into dark themes of betrayal, revenge and the importance of companionship. This movie is any director's dream at its very core.<br /><br />However, Sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking. The writing, provided by scribe Tim Sheridan, was just as breathtaking.<br /><br />The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen. Specifically speaking, the final scene (WARNING: SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!!) where Vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time, is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings I have ever seen. Sheridan is the next Robert Towne.<br /><br />In a final note it is obvious that this production was no small feat.<br /><br />Therefore much praise must be given to producer Scott Shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to Jerry Bruckheimer. Never before have I witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail. A producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and Shipley makes it look easy.<br /><br />All in all this film combines creative writing, stunning production and masterful direction. This is the art of film at its best. When the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is more.<br /><br />The Romeo Division is groundbreaking, a masterpiece and, most importantly, The Romeo Division is indeed art.",1,when i first saw the romeo division last spring my first reaction was brilliant however on future viewings i was provided with much more than masterful filmmaking this picture has a singular voice that will echo throughout the annuls of film historybr br the opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer jp sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainmentbr br sarro truly uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us along on a ride that envelops the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become accustomed to and dives deeply into dark themes of betrayal revenge and the importance of companionship this movie is any directors dream at its very corebr br however sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking the writing provided by scribe tim sheridan was just as breathtakingbr br the dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen specifically speaking the final scene warning: spoilers!!! spoilers!!! where vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings i have ever seen sheridan is the next robert townebr br in a final note it is obvious that this production was no small featbr br therefore much praise must be given to producer scott shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to jerry bruckheimer never before have i witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail a producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and shipley makes it look easybr br all in all this film combines creative writing stunning production and masterful direction this is the art of film at its best when the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is morebr br the romeo division is groundbreaking a masterpiece and most importantly the romeo division is indeed art,first saw romeo division last spring first reaction wa brilliant however future view wa provide much masterful filmmaking picture ha singular voice echo throughout annul film historybr br open montage provide splendid palette helmer jp sarro us establish art canvas entertainmentbr br sarro truly us camera paintbrush bring u along ride envelop audience tremendous action movie go beyond traditional format become accustom dive deeply dark theme betrayal revenge importance companionship movie director dream corebr br however sarro wa alone epic undertake write provide scribe tim sheridan wa breathtakingbr br dialogue wa precise direct give actor presence charisma screen specifically speak final scene warning: spoilers!!! spoilers!!! vanessa reveal one coalition villain time write dark tone one chill end ever see sheridan next robert townebr br final note obvious production wa small featbr br therefore much praise must give producer scott shipley seem creativity genius walk next jerry bruckheimer never witness production grand much attention direct every little detail producer job one hardest movie shipley make look easybr br film combine creative write stun production masterful direction art film best end film arrive thing desire morebr br romeo division groundbreaking masterpiece importantly romeo division indeed art,"WRB PRP RB VBD DT NN NN JJ NN PRP$ JJ NN VBD JJ RB IN JJ NNS PRP VBD VBN IN RB JJR IN JJ VBG DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN WDT MD VB IN DT NNS IN NN NN NNP DT NN NN VBZ DT JJ NN WDT NN FW NN VBZ TO VB PRP$ NN IN DT NN IN NN NN NN RB VBZ DT NN IN PRP$ NN IN PRP VBZ PRP RP IN DT NN WDT VBZ DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN WDT VBZ IN DT JJ NN PRP VBP VBN JJ IN CC VBZ RB IN JJ NNS IN NN NN CC DT NN IN NN DT NN VBZ DT NNS NN IN PRP$ JJ NN NN RB NN VBD RB JJ IN DT JJ VBG DT NN VBN IN JJ NN NN VBD RB RB JJ NN DT NN VBD RB JJ CC VB IN PRP VBD DT NNS JJ NN CC VBD IN DT NN RB VBG DT JJ NN NN : NNS . . .

100,100,"There is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the US version. The person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got. The US version of this show is everything that reality TV shouldn't be. Instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the US or if you beg hard enough you will receive. The rather vulgar product placement that takes place, particularly by Sears, is also uncalled for. Rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires, it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home, build something for the whole community ..... perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to. Giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses.",0,there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less
